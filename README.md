In order to install this plugin, all you need to do is drag the **BattleRoyaleKnockout.jar**
into the **plugins** folder in your Bukkit server directory. Create the folder if it's not
there already. Although this is developed and tested on Bukkit MC 1.12.1, it should work extensively
on most previous and successive versions of Bukkit.

I made a YouTube video showcasing this plugin:

This plugin shouldn't interfere with other plugins, however be wary that "core-gameplay" 
(ones that affect health and PVP) plugins may do so more than others.

If you're a nerd and like pulling apart code, go ahead. Steal a bit if you like.
It's all good, we all do it. Just be a lad and credit me :D
